            <p>My Bartending journey started in 2021, as after University and lockdowns, I wanted a new challenge, one that would help me improve my confidence and social skills. I quickly fell in love with the fast-paced atmosphere and environment and got hooked on the sales-per-hour metric, leading me to strategize my serving style and work hard to be the fastest bartender I could possibly be. Now since then, I have worked in many different venues gaining a wide umbrella of experience in different styles of bars and pubs. I have been given the opportunity through this job to grow, experience things and learn skills that I didn't think I could achieve.</p>
